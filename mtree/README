mtree.py defines MoiraTree, which walks a Moira list tree (calling
blanche recursively on all its elements). This data structure can then
be used to query information about the list. Two executable scripts
are provided:

        mquery LIST-NAME MEMBER
               prints 'True' if MEMBER is a member or submember of
               LIST-NAME, and 'False' otherwise.

        mwalk LIST-NAME
               prints out a tree-like list of all the members and
               submembers of the list. Handles cyclic trees.
