This repository contains a number of utilities I find useful on MIT's
Athena systems.

dropbox/
        A system for creating "semi-Public" folders for sharing data
        with specific people. Features automatic setup for
        cert-protected web access.

fixlink
        A simple script for removing intermediate steps in links. This
        is particularly useful for when you have some directory
        structure containing symlinks to /mit/... paths that you want
        to put on the web. web.mit.edu doesn't have the /mit
        automounter, so a file which is a symlink to /mit/foo/bar will
        not work; fixlink will detect the intermediate
        /mit/foo->/afs/athena.mit.edu/users/f/o/foo link and will
        replace the original's file symlink accordingly.

get-7.012-video
        A really quick and dirty wrapper I wrote for downloading
        videos for 7.012 (so you can play them on your own player
        instead of online). Currently only set up for Fall 2011,
        though it should not be hard to set up for other
        semesters. Requires rtmpdump.

mtree/
        A simple library for quickly querying large Moira
        lists. Provides two scripts --- one for recursively walking
        down a tree (can deal with cycles, unlike rblanche!) and one
        for quickly determining whether a particular user is on a
        given list (or any sublist)

temperature
        A simple scraper for http://thefuckingweather.com. It prints
        out the temperature to STDOUT, which makes it nice to
        incorporate it into other software. I use it in Barnowl.

wrappers/
        A collection of really simple wrappers (so far just
        "athrun...") for scripts in other people's lockers that I
        nevertheless find useful.
